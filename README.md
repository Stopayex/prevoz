This project demonstrates the use of JetBrains MPS to create a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for generating ride-sharing web applications.

With our DSL, developers can easily define applications where users can offer and request rides between locations. The generated web app includes features such as:

- User profiles
- Ride postings

## 📁 Structure
The repository contains:

- An MPS project implementing the DSL used to model ride-sharing applications.
- A frontend web application generated using the DSL.
- A backend server that supports the web app with data storage and logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

### Backend
Navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
